# MMSearch
This is a personal project of mine that I wanted to create to test my ability
to search and sort results in a quick and effcient manner. I would love for
others to comment and improve upon my work, so feel free to download and play
with the source code or just to have a tool for searching through the base
Dungeons and Dragons 5e Monster Manual.

The text file that I read and acquire my data from is included in the repository.
The most current and most easily expandable version is called "monster-manualv3.txt"
and the original version ripped straight from the roll20.net repository is called
"monster-manual.txt".

Currently Implemented Features:
-------------------------------
Adding and clearing search filters
Adding results sorting options
Monster Lookup
Clearing individual filters
Clearing results sorting options

Future Features:
----------------
More robust lookup information
